# AVR_Drivers
Hey everyone!

I've put together a bunch of AVR microcontroller drivers that I made during college. They cover the basics like GPIO, UART, Timers, and ADC. These should work with a bunch of different AVR chips, like the ATmega32 and ATmega32.

To use these drivers, you'll need a few things:

    An AVR compiler (like AVR-GCC)
    An IDE (like Atmel Studio, Eclipse or Microchip Studio)
    An AVR programmer

I've included some simple examples to get you started. Just grab the code, tweak it for your project, and you're good to go!

Each driver has its own documentation, so be sure to check those out for more details. I've also linked to some helpful tutorials and datasheets.

If you find any bugs or want to add new features, feel free to fork the repo and send me a pull request. Let's make these drivers even better together!

These drivers are open-source, so feel free to use them in your own projects.
